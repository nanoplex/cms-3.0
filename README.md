# cms-3.0

Nanoplex CMS (beta)

created by Mathias Hansen <mathias.hansen783@gmail.com>

I made this CMS because i pretty mouch made the same backend for every project i created, so this CMS manages the database and getting the right stuff to the right pages, so you can focus on the frontend code for the project.

I would love some feedback if you liked it, or if everyting was shit. I need to know, this is my first project i put out on the internet for the wholde world to see.

i hope you will like it, remember this is only a beta.
