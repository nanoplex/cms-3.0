# cms-3.0

Nanoplex CMS (beta)

Mathias Hansen mathias.hansen783@gmail.com

this is my cms, i created it to show what i can do, and to use it for cosutmers when i build sites for them.

It started with me notecing every time i created a new project i pretty mouch had to write the same code over and over again. and every time i did that i would forget someting.

So i decided to create my own CMS and make it as non oppoionated as possible. so you can build your frontend however you want, and it will be pretty easy to get to work with this CMS, If you know c# and asp.net and some javascript. There are loads of comments but just write a mail to me it there is something you dont understand.

I would love some feedback if you liked it, or if everyting was shit. I need to know, this is my first project i put out on the internet for the wholde world to see.

i hope you will like it, remember this is only a beta.
